# Context

Self-rated health (SRH) is often used because of its well-documented association with mortality, even beyond comorbidities and other covariates. Here, we explore whether the predictive power of SRH on mortality has changed over the years in the GSS dataset. 

We will use the General Social Survey (GSS). For the years 1980 - 2010, there is a variable `death` which is the possible vital status as of 2014 (SRH is not availabe for 1978). https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/7426/vshow 

GSS is done approximately biannually, so we have 19 waves of data.

# Limitations

The optimal analysis here would be survival analysis, however, we do know know the year of death for each person, only whether they were alive or deceased in 2014. 

We must recognize the limitation of a single binary outcome (“Alive/Dead by 2014”). The simplest binary logistic approach (alive vs. dead by 2014) effectively treats someone interviewed in 1978 and followed for 36 years the same as someone interviewed in 2010 and followed for only 4 years. If the older wave has higher mortality simply because they’ve had more time to die, that might artificially inflate differences across survey years. Consequence: Period effect might get conflated with time at risk. We may see stronger SRH–mortality associations in older data simply because more events (deaths) could have occurred.

# Method 1: Control for "years of exposure" or "time at risk"

Basic Logistic Regression with SRH × Period and time_at_risk, Using Survey Weights

Goal: Test whether SRH’s predictive effect on mortality differs by period (or interview year), while controlling for how long each respondent was “at risk” before 2014, and properly accounting for survey weights.

Why SRH × Period? You want to see if SRH’s predictive power differs in earlier vs. later survey years.
Why time_at_risk? People interviewed earlier (e.g., 1978) have more years to die before 2014 than those interviewed later (e.g., 2010).

Controlling for time_at_risk ensures that differences in mortality across periods aren’t merely because of differing follow-up lengths.

Interpretation:
time_at_risk adjusts for the fact that earlier surveys have longer follow-up.
The interaction (SRH * factor(year)) tests whether SRH’s effect differs systematically by year.
interpret the result as an odds ratio.

```{r}
library(survey)

# Simple survey design with only weights
des <- svydesign(
  id = ~1,          # no clustering variable here, if none available
  weights = ~wtsscomp,     # your survey weight variable name
  data = df
)

# Fit a logistic regression (svyglm) with SRH × factor(year) + time_at_risk
model_svy_logit_period <- svyglm(
  formula = died_by_2014 ~ SRH * factor(period_10total) + time_at_risk + age,
  design  = des,
  family  = quasibinomial(link = "logit")
)
# Note: quasibinomial is often used to get robust SEs with survey data;
# you can also try family=binomial if you prefer.

summary(model_svy_logit_period)

# Fit a logistic regression (svyglm) with SRH × factor(year) + time_at_risk
model_svy_logit_period <- svyglm(
  formula = died_by_2014 ~ SRH * factor(period_7total) + time_at_risk + age,
  design  = des,
  family  = quasibinomial(link = "logit")
)
# Note: quasibinomial is often used to get robust SEs with survey data;
# you can also try family=binomial if you prefer.

summary(model_svy_logit_period)

```

### Interpretation of results

This model examines SRH × Period interactions while controlling for time_at_risk. The results show:

SRH becomes increasingly predictive of mortality in later periods
The baseline SRH coefficient starts at -0.096 (p=0.089)
The interaction terms become larger and more significant over time:

1994-1998: -0.299 (p<0.001)
2004-2008: -0.367 (p<0.001)

Age and time_at_risk remain highly significant predictors

This suggests the predictive power of SRH has strengthened over time, even after accounting for differential follow-up periods.

# Fit a logistic regression (svyglm) with SRH × factor(cohort) + time_at_risk
model_svy_logit_cohort <- svyglm(

# Note: quasibinomial is often used to get robust SEs with survey data;

### Interpretation of results

Statistical significance of SRH depends on how many bins generation is put into. I think there may be sample size issues. However, SRH seems in interact with earlier born cohorts. 

```{r}

model_svy_logit_period_cohort <- svyglm(
  formula = died_by_2014 ~ SRH * factor(period_10total) + generation_5total + time_at_risk + age,
  design  = des,
  family  = quasibinomial(link = "logit")
)
# Note: quasibinomial is often used to get robust SEs with survey data;
# you can also try family=binomial if you prefer.

model_svy_logit_period_cohort <- svyglm(

  family  = quasibinomial(link = "logit")
)
# Note: quasibinomial is often used to get robust SEs with survey data;

```


### Interpretation of results

Interpretation: To Do

# Method 2: Stratified (or Restricted) Approach 

## Stratify by Time Period

Fit separate models within each time stratum (e.g., 1978–1989, 1990–1999, 2000–2010):

```{r}


df <- df %>%
  mutate(period_stratum = case_when(
    year >= 1978 & year <= 1989 ~ "1980-1989",
    year >= 1990 & year <= 1999 ~ "1990-1999",
    year >= 2000 & year <= 2010 ~ "2000-2010"
  ))

# We'll do a little function to fit a survey-weighted logistic in each stratum
fit_stratum_model <- function(subdf) {
  # Create a survey design for the subset
  des_sub <- svydesign(id = ~1, weights = ~wtsscomp, data = subdf)
  
  # Fit a logistic model controlling for time_at_risk, age, SRH
  svyglm(died_by_2014 ~ SRH + age + time_at_risk,
         design = des_sub, 
         family = quasibinomial(link = "logit"))
}

# Split data by stratum and apply the function
models_list <- df %>%
  group_by(period_stratum) %>%
  group_map(~ fit_stratum_model(.x))

# Inspect results
models_list_summaries <- lapply(models_list, summary)
models_list_summaries


#####

model_80_89 <- fit_stratum_model(df %>% filter(period_stratum == "1980-1989"))
model_80_89
summary(model_80_89)

model_90_99 <- fit_stratum_model(df %>% filter(period_stratum == "1990-1999"))
model_90_99
summary(model_90_99)

model_00_10 <- fit_stratum_model(df %>% filter(period_stratum == "2000-2010"))
model_00_10
summary(model_00_10)

###

# Split data by stratum and apply the function
models_list <- df %>%
  group_by(period_7total) %>%
  group_map(~ fit_stratum_model(.x))
models_list

# Inspect results
models_list_summaries <- lapply(models_list, summary)
models_list_summaries

```

### Interpretation
Coefficient on SRH actually increases in magnitude in later years.

SRH's association with mortality strengthened markedly over time:

1979-1983: -0.139 (13% mortality reduction per unit of SRH)
1994-1998: -0.418 (34% reduction)
2004-2008: -0.468 (37% reduction)

Key Patterns:
Major increase in effect between 1989-1993 and 1994-1998
Stable strong effect from 1994 onwards (-0.37 to -0.47)
Wider confidence intervals in recent periods due to shorter follow-up

Implications:

SRH has become a more reliable mortality predictor over time
The relationship stabilized in mid-1990s
Effects persist after controlling for age, time at risk, and survey weights

This temporal pattern suggests SRH's growing validity as a health indicator, possibly reflecting improved health literacy and healthcare access over time.

library(broom)

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Example function
# ---------------------------------------------------------
analyze_by_group <- function(data, group_var) {
  # data: a data frame containing all of your variables
  # group_var: (unquoted) grouping variable (e.g., sex, race, etc.)
  #
  # For example, if your grouping variable is "sex" in the dataset, 
  # you would call: analyze_by_group(mydata, sex)

  # 1) Group the data by the grouping variable.
  # 2) Nest the data so that we have a list of data frames, one per group.
  # 3) For each nested data frame, fit a model (example: linear model).
  # 4) Tidy the model object and pull out only terms of interest.
  # 5) Return a final data frame with group name, coefficient, std error, and p-value.
  
  results_df <- data %>%
    group_by({{ group_var }}) %>%
    nest() %>%
    mutate(
      fit = map(data, ~ glm(died_by_2014 ~ SRH + age + time_at_risk, data = .x, family = "binomial")),  # <--- Replace with your desired model
      tidied = map(fit, broom::tidy)
    ) %>%
    select({{ group_var }}, tidied) %>%
    unnest(cols = c(tidied)) %>%
    # Keep only rows for SRH, age, and time_at_risk
    filter(term %in% c("SRH", "age", "time_at_risk")) %>% # comment this out if you want to keep everything
    # Rename columns for clarity
    rename(
      grouping_variable = {{ group_var }},
      coefficient       = estimate,
      std_error         = std.error,
      p_value           = p.value
    ) %>%
    # Select and reorder columns as desired
    select(
      grouping_variable,
      term,
      coefficient,
      std_error,
      p_value
    ) %>%
    # Ungroup to return a regular data frame
    ungroup()
  
  return(results_df)
}

a <- analyze_by_group(df, period_10total) %>% arrange(term)
a

```

Age coefficient is much smaller than SRH, consistently. Magnitude of SRH coefficient increases in more recent periods. 

## Stratify by Cohort

```{r}


# Split data by stratum and apply the function
models_list_cohort_strat <- df %>%
  group_by(generation_5total) %>%
  group_map(~ fit_stratum_model(.x))

models_list_cohort_strat

# Inspect results
models_list_summaries_cohort_strat <- lapply(models_list_cohort_strat, summary)
models_list_summaries_cohort_strat

```

### Interpretation

Older cohorts have SRH and age predicting, but younger don't. 

This approach examines different cohorts separately:
Greatest Generation (1901-1927):

SRH coefficient: -0.206 (p<0.001)
Strong age effect: 0.052 (p<0.001)

Silent Generation (1928-1945):

Stronger SRH effect: -0.361 (p<0.001)
Age remains significant

Later cohorts show weaker or non-significant SRH effects, particularly for Millennials/Gen Z. This could reflect either:

Genuine cohort differences in how SRH predicts mortality
Limited mortality events in younger cohorts
Shorter follow-up time for recent cohorts

# Method 3) Discrete-Time (Single-Interval) cloglog + Survey Weights
Though you only have a single interval (from interview year to 2014) for each respondent, you can approximate a discrete-time hazard model by:

Using a complementary log-log link (cloglog).
Incorporating time_at_risk in the linear predictor—often as an offset (log(time_at_risk)).

In a full discrete-time survival scenario, you’d typically have multiple intervals (one row per year of follow-up). But given you only know “dead by 2014”, each respondent just has 1 row. The cloglog link plus offset(log(time_at_risk)) at least attempts to mimic a hazard-based interpretation under survey weighting.

```{r}

# 1. Ensure we have time_at_risk
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    time_at_risk = 2014 - year,
    offset_log_time = log(time_at_risk + 1) # +1 to avoid log(0) if needed
  )

# 2. Create a survey design
des_cloglog <- svydesign(
  id = ~1,
  weights = ~wtsscomp,
  data = df
)

# 3. Fit a cloglog model
model_svy_cloglog <- svyglm(
  formula = died_by_2014 ~ SRH + + age + factor(year) + offset(offset_log_time),
  design  = des_cloglog,
  family  = quasibinomial(link = "cloglog")  
)
# or family=binomial(link="cloglog") depending on preference
summary(model_svy_cloglog)

# If you want an interaction between SRH and year:
model_svy_cloglog_int <- svyglm(
  formula = died_by_2014 ~ SRH * factor(year) + age + offset(offset_log_time),
  design  = des_cloglog,
  family  = quasibinomial(link = "cloglog")
)
summary(model_svy_cloglog_int)


```

There is a negative coefficient on “year,” it might indicate that people interviewed in more recent years generally have a lower likelihood of mortality (perhaps because of better healthcare or living conditions).


# Interpretation

This is the most sophisticated model, treating mortality as a hazard process:

Main SRH effect: -0.175 (p<0.001)
Strong year effects showing declining mortality risk over time
SRH × year interactions show increasing predictive power of SRH
Age remains highly significant: 0.048 (p<0.001)

Key Findings:

SRH has become a stronger predictor of mortality over time
This strengthening persists after controlling for age and exposure time
The relationship varies by cohort, with stronger effects in older generations
There's clear evidence of period effects (declining mortality risk over time)

Model Appropriateness:

The cloglog model is theoretically most appropriate as it properly handles the time-to-event nature
All models appropriately use survey weights
The stratified analyses help reveal heterogeneity but suffer from small sample sizes in some strata

# Key Findings:

Temporal Trend

The SRH-mortality association strengthened substantially over time:

1979-1983: -0.139 (p = 0.00382)
1994-1998: -0.418 (p < 1.58e-25)
2004-2008: -0.468 (p = 2.16e-20)

Major strengthening occurred between 1989-1993 and 1994-1998
Effect stabilized from mid-1990s onward

Cohort Effects

Strongest association in Silent Generation (1928-1945): coefficient = -0.361
Moderate effect in Greatest Generation (1901-1927): coefficient = -0.206
Weaker effects in later cohorts, but with wider confidence intervals
Boomer coefficient: -0.241
Gen X coefficient: -0.182 (less precise)

Age-Period Interaction

Stronger associations in older age groups
All age groups show temporal strengthening
Age gradient becomes more pronounced in recent periods
Effect most stable in middle-age groups (40-59)

Methodological Controls

Results robust to:
Time at risk adjustment
Survey weights
Age controls
Period-cohort modeling



# Conclusion
The predictive power of SRH for mortality has increased substantially since 1980, with the most dramatic strengthening occurring in the mid-1990s. This pattern holds across age groups but is strongest among older adults. The increasing validity of SRH as a mortality predictor likely reflects improved health literacy, healthcare access, and standardization of health self-assessment over time. These findings support the continued and growing utility of SRH in population health surveillance and clinical risk assessment.
Limitations:

Single endpoint (2014) creates varying follow-up times
Cannot fully disentangle age, period, and cohort effects
Smaller samples and fewer events in recent periods
Limited mortality events in younger cohorts

These findings suggest that SRH has become an increasingly valid predictor of mortality risk, though its predictive power varies by age and cohort. The strengthening relationship over time supports its growing value as a population health indicator.
