## Lab #2 -- Temporal Processes


## 1. (a) Run an OLS regression, including at least one independent variable and a time variable (as dummies).  Explain how you think your independent variable relates to your dependent variable.  Interpret your results.  Did you find what you expected to find?    
## (b) Then run a fixed effect model version of that OLS model.  Interpret your results.  Did you find what you expected to find?  Why?  Why not? 
## (c) Then include an additional predictor in your fixed effects model that you think might account for the initial relationship you found between your X and your Y.  What effect does that new independent variable have in your new regression?
## (d) Then run a random effects model equivalent to your fixed effects model in step (b).  Interpret the results.
## (e) Run a Hausman test to compare your fixed effects and your random effects models.  What do you conclude?

Others think that the government should not concern itself with reducing this income difference between the rich and the poor. Think of a score of 1 as meaning that the government ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor, and a score of 7 meaning that the government should not concern itself with reducing income differences."

## Here is the firstD command in the QMSS package

#' Compute first differences 
#'
#' @param var Variable to be first-differenced.
#' @param group Optional grouping variable (see 'Details').
#' @param df Optional data frame containing \code{var} and \code{group} (see 'Details'). 
#' @details If \code{df} is specified then \code{group} must also be specified. So it is possible 
#' to specify all three parameters, \code{var} and \code{group} only, or \code{var} by itself. 
#' An example of when one might wish to omit both \code{group} and \code{df} is when using \code{firstD} 
#' in conjunction with  \pkg{plyr}'s \code{\link[plyr]{ddply}} (see 'Examples'). If \code{df} is specified then it 
#' should be sorted by \code{group} and, if necessary, a second variable (e.g. time) that orders the 
#' observations of \code{var} in the appropriate sequence. 
#' @return \code{firstD(var)} returns a first-differenced version of \code{var}. 
#' \code{firstD(var,group)} returns a first-differenced version of \code{var} by \code{group}. 
#' And \code{firstD(var,group,df)} returns a first-differenced version of \code{var} by \code{group}, 
#' where \code{var} and \code{group} are searched for in \code{df}. Note that the first value of 
#' \code{firstD(var)} will be \code{NA} since there is no difference to compute. Similarly, for
#' \code{firstD(var,group)} and \code{firstD(var,group,df)} the first value for each group 
#' will be \code{NA}.

## (a) Run an OLS regression, including at least one independent variable and a time variable (as dummies).  Explain how you think your independent variable relates to your dependent variable.  Interpret your results.  Did you find what you expected to find?    
## If you have bill troubles, does that make you more inclined to support active measures to equalize wealth?

summary(lm(equalize ~ bills + as.factor(panelwave), lab)) ## simple OLS ##

##Answer: it looks like those are related

## Here is the same regression as above, within plm package

eq.pool <- plm(equalize ~ bills + as.factor(panelwave), # model formula
               index = c("idnum", "panelwave"), # id & time variables
               model = "pooling", 
               data = lab) ## this is equivalent to above OLS ##

summary(eq.pool)

## Here is the first difference model for this

eq.fd <- plm(equalize ~ bills + as.factor(panelwave), # model formula
             index = c("idnum", "panelwave"), # id & time variables
             model = "fd", 
             data = lab) ## first differences ##

summary(eq.fd)

## (b) Then run a fixed effect model version of that OLS model.  Interpret your results.  Did you find what you expected to find?  Why?  Why not? 

eq.fe <- plm(equalize ~ bills + as.factor(panelwave), # model formula
             index = c("idnum", "panelwave"), # id & time variables
             model = "within", 
             data = lab) ## fixed effects ##

summary(eq.fe)

## The result is curious: if one goes from not having to worry about bills, to worrying about them, their thirst for redistribution DROPS by .29 points (though only marginally statistically significantly)


## (c) Then include an additional predictor in your fixed effects model that you think might account for the initial relationship you found between your X and your Y.  What effect does that new independent variable have in your new regression?
## Perhaps people got more conservative for other reasons too, so I will include polviews, which is how people place themselves on a liberal-conservative scale


eq.fe2 <- plm(equalize ~ bills + polviews + as.factor(panelwave), # model formula
              index = c("idnum", "panelwave"), # id & time variables
              model = "within", 
              data = lab) ## fixed effects ##

summary(eq.fe2)


## (d) Then run a random effects model equivalent to your fixed effects model in step (b).  Interpret the results.


eq.re <- plm(equalize ~ bills + as.factor(panelwave), # model formula
             index = c("idnum", "panelwave"), # id & time variables
             model = "random", 
             data = lab) ## random effects ##

summary(eq.re)

## (e) Run a Hausman test to compare your fixed effects and your random effects models.  What do you conclude? 


phtest(eq.fe, eq.re) ## Hausman test comparing RE and FE ##
