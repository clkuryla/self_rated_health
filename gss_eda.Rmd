Take a look at GSS dataset, what's available, some trends, etc. 

The first variable of interest is "health", which will be the main subject of our analysis. 

https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/437/vshow

Question on survey: "Would you say your own health, in general, is excellent, good, fair, or  poor?"

# Fetch GSS data
