Take a look at GSS dataset, what's available, some trends, etc. 

The first variable of interest is "health", which will be the main subject of our analysis. 

https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/437/vshow

Question on survey: "Would you say your own health, in general, is excellent, good, fair, or  poor?"

# Fetch GSS data 

```{r fetch_data, eval = FALSE}

# It's a bit excessive to download the entire GSS dataset every time we knit, so lets just save some variables of interest and write it out for future use.

data_gss <- as.data.frame(gss_all) %>%

# Load and clean data

Here we'll load our data, clean some unwanted values, and recode the unintuitive variables.

```{r load_and_clean_data}
data_gss <- read_csv("data/extracted_gss_variables.csv") %>% 
  filter(cohort != 9999) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(health = 5 - health)  %>%  # reverse the coding so it's more intuitive (higher number for excellent, lower number for poor)
  mutate(happy = 4 - happy) %>% # same
  mutate(life = 4 - life) %>% # reverse again, these variables tend to be unintuitively ordered!!!
  mutate(satfin = 4 - satfin) 
```

## Peek at GSS df
```{r head}

head(data_gss, n = 10)

glimpse(data_gss)

```


## Life expectancy data

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/
data_le <- read_csv("big_data/WPP2024_Demographic_Indicators_Medium.csv")
data_le <- data_le %>% 
  filter(Location == "United States of America")

# Just get the years of interest for merging with the gss data
year_range <- seq(min(data_gss$year), max(data_gss$year))
data_le <- data_le %>% 
  filter(Time %in% year_range)

write_csv(data_le, "data/un_life_expectancy_etc.csv")

```


# Histograms

Let's make a few quick histograms to get a sense of the survey response distributions.

```{r histograms}

# Tidyverse and flexible number of histograms

library(patchwork)

# Create list to store ggplot objects
plot_list <- list()

# Loop through column names and create plots
for (var in colnames(data_gss)) {
  if (is.numeric(data_gss[[var]])) {  # Only create histograms for numeric columns
    p <- ggplot(data_gss, aes(x = .data[[var]])) +  # Use .data[[var]] for tidy evaluation
      geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "pink", color = "hotpink") +
      theme_minimal()
    
    plot_list[[var]] <- p
  }
}

# Combine all plots using patchwork and add a title
combined_plot <- wrap_plots(plot_list, ncol = 3) +
  plot_annotation(title = "Histograms of Survey Responses")

# Display the combined plot
print(combined_plot)



```


# Correlation Heatmap

Just to get some idea and familiarize ourselves with the data.

```{r}
correlation_auto <- cor(data_gss)
knitr::kable(correlation_auto)

# Create a heatmap

#upper_tri <- matrixcalc::upper.triangle(correlation_auto)
#melted_cormat <- reshape2::melt(upper_tri, na.rm = TRUE)

melted_cormat <- reshape2::melt(cor(data_gss), na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(data = melted_cormat, aes(Var2, Var1, fill = value))+
 geom_tile(color = "white")+
 scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "white", 
   midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab", 
   name="Pearson\nCorrelation") +
  theme_minimal()+ 
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, 
     hjust = 1))+
 coord_fixed() +
  geom_text(aes(Var2, Var1, label = if_else(value != 0, as.character(round(value, digits = 2)), " ")))
```

# Mean health over Age/Period/Cohort

Now let's take a look at the trend of people's self-rated health over time, as well as by age, and by birthyear.

```{r over_apc}

# Mean health over time, age, and birth year

data_gss %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health)) +
  geom_line(color = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(title = "Period: Self-Rated Health Each Year",
       subtitle = "(all ages together)" )

data_gss %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = mean_health)) +
  geom_line(color = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(title = "Age: Self-Rated Health By Age" ,
       subtitle = "(all years together)" )

data_gss %>% 
  group_by(cohort) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cohort, y = mean_health)) +
  geom_line(color = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(title = "Cohort: Self-Rated Health by Birth Year",
       subtitle = "(all years together)" )

```





# Cohorts 

Let's explore how each cohort tends to rate their health when at the same age.

```{r more_cohorts}

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(cohort = cut(cohort, breaks = 6)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, cohort) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = mean_health, color = cohort)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(cohort = cut(cohort, breaks = 6)) %>% 
  group_by(year, cohort) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health, color = cohort)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(cohort = cut(cohort, breaks = 6)) %>% 
  group_by(happy, cohort) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = happy, y = mean_health, color = cohort)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(cohort = cut(cohort, breaks = 6)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, cohort) %>% 
  summarize(mean_happy = mean(happy)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = mean_happy, color = cohort)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(age = cut(age, breaks = 6)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_happy = mean(happy)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_happy, color = age)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(age = cut(age, breaks = 6)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health, color = age)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(cohort = cut(cohort, breaks = 6)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(cohort, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health, color = cohort)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(cohort = cut(cohort, breaks = 6)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(year, cohort) %>% 
  summarize(mean_happy = mean(happy)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_happy, color = cohort)) +
  geom_line()

```


## Interesting and seemingly robust

Well, this is probably the most interesting graph. Let's try different numbers of categories of age.

```{r multiple_cohort_breaks_health}
data_gss %>% 
  mutate(age = cut(age, breaks = 6)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health, color = age)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(age = cut(age, breaks = 10)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health, color = age)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(age = cut(age, breaks = 3)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health, color = age)) +
  geom_line()

data_gss %>% 
  mutate(age = cut(age, breaks = 4)) %>% # Create cohorts with 6 breaks
  group_by(age, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_health, color = age)) +
  geom_line()
```

# Relationship of self-rated health to age, separated out by years

Well it seems like the spread of self-rated health among ages decreases as time goes on (later years). Let's look at that.

```{r health_v_age_per_year}
# health vs age per year
data_gss %>% 
  group_by(age, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_health = mean(health)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = mean_health)) +
  geom_line(color = "cornflowerblue") +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  labs(title = "Self-Rated Health By Age (Per Year)" )
```
