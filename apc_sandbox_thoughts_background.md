# Main components

1.  Pick some variables of interest
2.  Explain what variables were picked
3.  APC: Plots of various APC dimensions

- (Unpooled: Run regression for one time period)

4.  APC: Additional plots of remaining APC dimensions

- (Unpooled: Run regression for another time period)

5.  APC: Run a parsimonious regression of age period cohort variables

- (Unpooled: Interpret at least some of the coefficients)

6.  APC: Interpret the results of the regression

- (Unpooled: Formally compare coefficients between time periods)

7.  APC: Explain why the parsimonious model makes sense

- Unpooled: Explain results results

# Extra ideas

- “secret weapon” (coefficent for each years) of “happy” (or w/e) as a
  predictor of “health”
- data missingness figure
- mixtures?!?

# Potential covariates

- specific health conditions – but there are a lot!! maybe a faceted
  graph?

# Misc thoughts

- How do we incorporate adjusted age?
  - Prospective age
    - life expectancy - current age

    - percent spent

    - # of years left

      - dichotomous if over/under 10/15 years left

    - # of percent left

# To do

- Find some more potential covariates
- Read the two articles recommended
  - first
  - <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37032706/>
