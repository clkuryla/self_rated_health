Here’s a summary of the interesting findings from my analysis of
self-rated health in the GSS dataset so far.

See <https://github.com/clkuryla/self_rated_health/blob/main/gss_eda.md>
for more EDA and details.

- `health` The first variable of interest is “health”, which will be the
  main subject of our analysis.

<https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/437/vshow>

Question on survey: “Would you say your own health, in general, is
excellent, good, fair, or poor?”

Coded in this analysis (it was recoded from the raw data) as: 4 -
Excellent 3 - Good 2 - Fair 1 - Poor

Other variables used are:

- `age`
  - Age of respondent at time of survey
- `year`
  - Year of survey
- `cohort`
  - Birth year of respondent

Additional covariates to come.
